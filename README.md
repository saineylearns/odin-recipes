This current project is just a culmination of everything 
I've learned so far.

<!--It includes cool stuff like these HTML comments I've discovered<!-->

Cool right? this is only my 8th day of learning to code so I've still got lots of learning to do. But it's going well so far. I just have to keep on pushing myself, be patient and study, study, study!

This is just me testing out committing git messages.

I've now downloaded conventional commits which will make committing updates
easier.
